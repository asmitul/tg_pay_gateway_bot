- Completed Implementation Plan Step 28: added GitHub Actions release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) that triggers on `main` pushes or manual dispatch, logs into GHCR via `GITHUB_TOKEN`, builds the Dockerfile image, pushes SHA and `latest` tags under `ghcr.io/<repo_owner>/tg-pay-gateway-bot`, and exposes commit/image tags plus the digest as workflow outputs for downstream deploys.
- Completed Implementation Plan Step 27: added GitHub Actions CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) for push/PR to main that caches Go modules, enforces `go fmt ./...` with diff check, runs `go test ./...` with logs uploaded as artifacts, and builds `./cmd/bot`; ready to validate in a PR.
- Completed Implementation Plan Step 26: ran the final smoke checklist—`go test ./...` and `go build ./cmd/bot` pass, `-config-only` succeeds with dummy env and fails clearly when required vars are empty, and `docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up -d mongo` brings Mongo up healthy; Telegram-connected flows (/start, /ping, owner-only commands, live registration) remain unverified pending a real `TELEGRAM_TOKEN`/`BOT_OWNER`.
- Completed Implementation Plan Step 25: extended `docker-compose.local.yml` with a `bot` service built from the repo Dockerfile/tag `tg-pay-gateway-bot:local`, depends on the Mongo healthcheck, maps `8080:8080`, and injects required env (`TELEGRAM_TOKEN`, `BOT_OWNER`, `MONGO_URI=mongodb://mongo:27017`, `MONGO_DB=tg_bot_dev`, `APP_ENV=development`). Ready for local stack bring-up with `BOT_OWNER`/`TELEGRAM_TOKEN` supplied; Telegram E2E validation pending real credentials.
- Completed Implementation Plan Step 24: added a multi-stage Dockerfile (Go 1.25 alpine builder -> distroless runtime, non-root user, port 8080 exposed), trimmed the build context with `.dockerignore`, built image `tg-pay-gateway-bot:local`, and verified `docker run ... -config-only` with dummy env vars; `go test ./...` still passing.
- Completed Implementation Plan Step 23: added HTTP `/healthz` endpoint on `HTTP_PORT` returning `{"status":"ok"}` or `{"status":"degraded","mongo":"error"}` based on a 2s Mongo ping, wired the health server into main with graceful shutdown, and added unit tests; `go test ./...` passing.
- Completed Implementation Plan Step 22: implemented graceful shutdown with signal-aware polling stop, a 10s Telegram shutdown wait, Mongo disconnect timeout, and a final shutdown completion log; `go test ./...` passing.
- Completed Implementation Plan Step 21: added structured per-update logging with Telegram timestamps, handler names, chat/user IDs, and update types, wiring handler selection into the update log; updated metadata extraction helpers and tests; `go test ./...` passing.
- Completed Implementation Plan Step 20: added owner-only `/status` command that checks the Mongo-backed owner role (BOT_OWNER match) before execution, replies with env and live user/group counts using a stats provider with error fallbacks, and wired new dependencies through Telegram client/main with unit tests; `go test ./...` passing.
- Completed Implementation Plan Step 19: added `/ping` health command returning env/uptime/Mongo status with a 2s Mongo ping, injected process start time and Mongo checker into Telegram client, exposed store.Manager Ping helper, and expanded tests; `go test ./...` passing.
- Completed Implementation Plan Step 18: implemented `/start` command replying in private chats with a base-build welcome, role hint (owner vs user from configured BOT_OWNER), and registered status; ignored in groups with structured logs only; added handler wiring to include owner ID; expanded tests for /start replies and user registration on start; `go test ./...` passing.

- Completed Implementation Plan Step 17: added group registrar to upsert group chats with joined/last seen timestamps and trimmed titles, wired Telegram default handler to register groups on group/supergroup updates with error logging, and added unit tests; `go test ./...` passing.
- Completed Implementation Plan Step 16: added user registrar that upserts new users with default `role=user`, tracks `last_seen_at`/`updated_at` on every update, wired Telegram default handler to invoke it for all updates with `user_id`, and extended the user domain model to persist `last_seen_at`; `go test ./...` passing.
- Completed Implementation Plan Step 15: added domain models for users/groups with role priority mapping, repositories to insert/fetch records with joined/last seen timestamps, and unit tests using Mongo fakes to store/retrieve sample records; `go test ./...` passing.
- Completed Implementation Plan Step 5: added config loader with APP_ENV-driven dotenv support, required key validation, and HTTP port/log level defaults.
- Added config unit tests covering success, missing required keys, invalid BOT_OWNER/HTTP_PORT, and .env development load path; `go test ./...` passing.
- Wired cmd/bot/main.go to fail fast on config errors and print a simple success message.
- Completed Implementation Plan Step 6: added `-config-only` dry-run flag printing a redacted config summary, plus Mongo URI validation and masking tests to fail fast on bad values.
- Completed Implementation Plan Step 7: added logrus-based structured logging with env-aware formatting (JSON in production, text in development), standard fields (ts/level/msg/service/env), info/warn/error helpers, and contextual user/chat/event support with tests.
- Wired cmd/bot startup to the logging module, keeping config-only output while logging configuration errors and startup details through the new logger; `go test ./...` passing.
- Completed Implementation Plan Step 8: added `memory-bank/error-handling-guidelines.md` covering return-vs-handle rules, log level mapping, required context fields, and example classifications.
- Completed Implementation Plan Step 9: added `docker-compose.local.yml` for MongoDB 6.0 (dev no-auth, persistent volume, default DB `tg_bot_dev`), started the container via Docker Compose, and verified connectivity by creating a `step9_smoke` collection through `mongosh`.
- Completed Implementation Plan Step 10: built `internal/store.Manager` to create/ping a Mongo client, expose `users`/`groups` collection helpers, and close cleanly; added faked-client unit tests and wired cmd/bot to connect/disconnect with 10s/5s timeouts. Added mongo-driver dependency via `go mod tidy`; `go test ./...` passing.
- Completed Implementation Plan Step 11: added `EnsureBaseIndexes` to create unique `users.user_id` and `groups.chat_id` indexes, invoked during startup with a dedicated timeout, and documented the base collections; `go test ./...` passing.
- Completed Implementation Plan Step 12: wired Telegram long polling via `github.com/go-telegram/bot` with allowed updates (message, edited_message, callback_query, my_chat_member, chat_member), default logging handler, and signal-driven shutdown; added unit tests for bot setup and update metadata; `go test ./...` passing.
- Completed Implementation Plan Step 13: introduced a Telegram message router to classify private vs group chats, dispatch `/start` vs unknown commands, and route non-command text to a generic handler with clear routing logs; refreshed handler tests and `go test ./...` is passing.
- Completed Implementation Plan Step 14: added owner bootstrap registrar to upsert the configured BOT_OWNER with role=owner, demote any prior owners to admin, wire startup to run it, and verified with `go test ./...`.
